<b>REMINDER</b>: Do not use <b>Password Vault</b> to autofill any <b>Text Input</b> field/passcode inside <b>Password Vault</b>

How autofill work ?
- Select or focus on any <b>Text Input</b> field inside any apps then long-press <b>Enter</b> button

Why <b>Password Vault</b> keep asking me to re-enter the <b>Passcode</b> ?
- <b>Password Vault</b> does not keep the <b>Passcode</b> in memory during runtime, so it required the user to re-enter the <b>Passcode</b> for each decryption operation

<b>Passcode</b> requirement:
- Exact length is 10 characters
- Must contain at least 1 numeric, 1 uppercase and 1 lowercase

How <b>Password Vault</b> encrypt sensitive data ?
1. <b>Password Vault</b> use <b>RSA-OAEP</b> algorithm to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data. <b>RSA-OAEP</b> algorithm required a <b>private key</b>(only for decryption) and a <b>public key</b>(only for encryption). Both keys were generated during setup process and saved locally
2. To secured the <b>RSA-OAEP's private key</b>(saved locally), <b>Password Vault</b> use <b>AES-GCM</b> algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the <b>private key</b>. This algorithm required user to enter the <b>Passcode</b> during encryption and decryption process
3. <b>Passcode</b> are the most critical data. <b>Password Vault</b> does not store it in plain text but hashes the <b>Passcode</b> using the <b>Bcrypt</b> algorithm before storing the hashed output locally. To verify the <b>Passcode</b>, this hashing algorithm will compare the <b>Passcode</b> with the hashed output(stored locally) before proceed to decryption process
